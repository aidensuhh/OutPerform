## About the Project
This project implements a comprehensive strategy for selecting and optimizing a portfolio from any list of random stocks. The core objective is to design and implement an algorithm that utilizes different financial concepts to evaluate the performance of each stock and choose 12 stocks with the highest performance to maximize the chance of beating the market, which we defined to be the average between the return of each index for the TSX 60 and the S&P 500 over a period of time. 

The workflow integrates:
- Financial data extraction
- Filtering algorithms
- Correlation analysis
- Implied Volatility calculations
- Exponential Moving Average(EMA) calculations
- Sharpe ratio evaluations
The selected stocks are then weighted to maximize potential returns while adhering to predefined constraints.
